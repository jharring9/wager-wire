# Wager Wire

### To do
- Standardize timing for frontend
- Grab game results -- add to game object
- Scoring lambda -- things to consider -- individual bets (result: win/loss/null) AND the whole slip (profit, scoringComplete) gets scored (run a few times per day on the weekend)
- Standings / this week's bets
- games lock at individual times
- "more team data" on wager page
- Edit display name and password
